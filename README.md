# Pokemon
Data Analysis Project in Python using Pokemon dataset
In this project, we'll use a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about Pokemon.

Step 1: Defining the Problem
Our goal is to analyze the Pokemon dataset and gain insights into the characteristics of different types of Pokemon. Specifically, we want to answer the following questions:
1- Which type of Pokemon is the strongest based on their overall stats?
2- How does the distribution of different Pokemon types compare?
3- What is the correlation between the different Pokemon stats?
4- What is the most common primary and secondary type combination?
5- Which Pokemon has the highest and lowest total stats?
6- How does the 'Total' stat vary for each Pokemon type?
7- Which Pokemon has the highest and lowest speed?
8- How does the 'Speed' stat vary for each Pokemon type?
9- Is there a correlation between the 'Legendary' status of a Pokemon and its 'Total' stats?

# After finishing our analysis as showed in the python file and HTML file also, We can get the insights as following:
. The most common primary type among Pokemon is Water, followed by Normal and Grass.
2.The most common secondary type among Pokemon is Flying, followed by Ground and Poison.
3.The most common primary and secondary type combination is Water-.
4.The Pokemon with the highest total stats is Arceus, while the Pokemon with the lowest total stats is Sunkern.
5.The Pokemon with the highest speed is Deoxys Speed Forme, while the Pokemon with the lowest speed is Shuckle.
6.Legendary Pokemon tend to have higher total stats compared to non-legendary Pokemon.
7.The distribution of total stats varies for each Pokemon type, with some types having a wider range of total stats than others.
8.The distribution of speed stats also varies for each Pokemon type, with some types having a wider range of speed stats than others.
